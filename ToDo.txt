ToDo for first release to openrepos:
- 
- mainpage needs a progressbar.
- names of workouts still not good. Workouts are not sorted properly due to this.
- search for all "Rena" and replace
- Style first page list view like in meerun (upper part of page should not scroll)
- bluetooth data logging function
- translation to german language
- support all workout types from meerun
- cover dialog needs complete workover
	- remove app name, add app icon
- implement autopause
- save pause time to gpx file. Look in Meerun gpx file where to save pause data.
- record page workover	
	- choose what to display on the fields
	- add more data to view
		- current, minimum, maximum height (gps)
		- up/down travelled height
		- energy kcal
		- average speed/tempo
		- speed/tempo of last 100m/1km
		- top speed/tempo
		- average, minimum, maximum heart rate 
		- pause time
- alert system:
	- vibration alert / sound alert
	- send vibration also to pebble via dbus call provided by rockpool
	- make sound file configurable or changeable
	- alert thresholds:
		- heart rate upper and lower each with hysteresis
		- speed upper and lower each with hysteresis


ToDo on the long run:
- view diagrams on the statistics page. See app "Rush Hour" which is on openrepos.
- make volume of audio messages adjustable
- Messagebox needs to be extended. If a page is locked to portrait mode, messagebox needs also be locked to this mode.
- check if bluetooth is active. If not, switch it on. (see file ActionDisableBluetooth.qml in app slumber-master, or rockpool.qml)
- introduce configurable lock page (LCD mode, AMOLED mode)
- Record page: replace menu items (stop, pause, continue, start) with buttons
- support workouts without gps e.g. indoor activities
- choose metrics, km/miles
- new workout icons
- voice announcements
- pebble integration (currently waiting for abranson: https://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1528627&postcount=634)
- ability to pause runnig music when doing voice announcements
- use scout server as map tile provider (wait for Jolla dudes introducing QT5.6 to SFOS)
- introduce lap function
- CRC check for Zephyr HxM data packets
- BLE heart rate devices support (currently waiting for kimmoli to bring this to OPX)
- Waiter for mainpage while histroy data (GPX files) is loading


Bugs:
- music is paused and resumed even when no music is played. Detect first if music is playing!
- after bt scan and finding new HRM device, not able to connect. First need to restart app.
- sometimes there is a view problem on mainpage after a completed workout.
- compiler issue, comparison between signed and unsigned
- write to log file is not working, strange no error or something...
- sometimes, maybe if app is left on cover view or even in background, screen on is not longer working
- GPS starts with app start. Make it start with recordpage.
- autosave file might not get deleted after a training session
	- complete autosave mechanism must be checked. There are UI problems with this also.
	- if autosave is there on start on app, ask user if to resume workout
	- bring HRM values to autosave file



Completed:
- pause music if audio message is played
- fix mapcircle on recordpage
- [W] unknown:167 - file:///usr/share/harbour-laufhelden/qml/pages/RecordPage.qml:167: TypeError: Cannot call method 'addCoordinate' of undefined
- if a workout is cancelled before it could start properly (bad GPS), the HRM is also disconnected and you have to wait 3 seconds.
	This is a bigger thing. Maybe disable button if GPS is not online? That would also solve the problem!
- if recordpage is left, HRM is disconnected. Disconnect only if workout ends!
- In PreRecordPage, disable HRM option if there is no HRM device address
- In RecordPage, disable HRM optiion if there is no HRM device address
- On recordpage: if the map is maximized, there is a forward jump enabled to prerecordpage. This is a bug!
- Set useragent for map and app settings file to beter values
- solved issue with backjumping to mainpage. Problem was, pagestack.currentpage gives null within Component.onCompleted. Don't use this anymore!!!
- mainpage list does not fit to height of page
- after a new workout is recorded it is not viewed on main page
- record page must keep screen on (configurable)
- speed indicator for record page
- filename:
	use the local date&time as well as workout
- name:
	use the textbox text from the savedialog.
	make a text presiction, bring local date&time as well as workout to the text box on start dialog
- description:
	use the textbox text from the savedialog.
	Make no prediction and leave text box empty on start dialog.
- compatibility with new HRM belt
