ToDo for next release to openrepos:
- set release date to .changes file														OK
- compile with translation generation and complete translation to german language		OK
- set new version number to yaml and spec files											OK
- clean project and compile on release													OK	



ToDo for second next release to openrepos:

- Edit workout and save to GPX
- GPS starts with app start. Make it start with prerecordpage. This is related to the pause problem.
- there is a bug with pause function. Time is runnning further. Must be debugged in live mode.
- add buttons to map
	- center position
	- switch between center position/center track mode
- add over/below average speed, average pace and average heart rate to record page
- introduce configurable lock page (LCD mode, AMOLED mode)
- event voice announcements	
	- GPS online/offline
	- start, stop, pause, resume workout
	- ...
- cyclic voice announcements	
	- every 0,5-10 km
	- maximum three parameters
	- distance, speed, pace, HR



ToDo on the long run:
- check if speedoverground in QGeoPositionInfo is eventually better then own speed calculation
- implement workout comparison. Compare current workout with virtual workout in the past
- AM/PM mode for recordpage
- support all workout types from meerun (is not possible because export function in meerun is broken for many workout types, even on android)
- rename workouts on mainpage
- introduce reward system:
	- fastest run 5/10/20/40 km
	- longest run (distance/time)
	- most workouts in a week/month
	- most distance in a week/month
	- most time in a week/month
	-  5km in under 30/25/20/15 mins
	- 10km in under 1h/55/50/48/45/40/35/30 mins
- view burned calories on mainpage and recordpage and detailspage
- bluetooth data logging function (writing to files does not work???)
- introduce female voice
- alert system:
	- vibration alert / sound alert
	- send vibration also to pebble via dbus call provided by rockpool (does not exist. Have to do this myself?)
	- make sound file configurable or changeable
- record page workover, add more data to view
		- current, minimum, maximum height (gps)
		- up/down travelled height
		- energy kcal
		- average speed/tempo -> OK
		- speed/tempo of last 100m/1km
		- top speed/tempo
		- average, minimum, maximum heart rate 
		- pause time
- implement autopause
- save pause time to gpx file. Look in Meerun gpx file where to save pause data.
- Style first page list view like in meerun (upper part of page should not scroll)
- enable night mode automatically. 
- view diagrams on the statistics page. See app "Rush Hour" which is on openrepos.
- make volume of audio messages adjustable
- Messagebox needs to be extended. If a page is locked to portrait mode, messagebox needs also be locked to this mode.
- check if bluetooth is active. If not, switch it on. (see file ActionDisableBluetooth.qml in app slumber-master, or rockpool.qml)
- support workouts without gps e.g. indoor activities
- choose metrics, km/miles
- new workout icons
- pebble integration (currently waiting for abranson: https://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1528627&postcount=634)
- use scout server as map tile provider (waiting for Jolla: https://talk.maemo.org/showpost.php?p=1528801&postcount=257)
- introduce lap function
- CRC check for Zephyr HxM data packets
- BLE heart rate devices support (currently waiting for kimmoli to bring this to OPX)


Bugs:
- sometimes there is a view problem on mainpage after a completed workout.
- if HRM is active and record page is left and then opened again, we get a BT error.
- after bt scan and finding new HRM device, not able to connect. First need to restart app.
- compiler issue, comparison between signed and unsigned
- write to log file is not working, strange no error or something...
- sometimes, maybe if app is left on cover view or even in background, screen on is not longer working





Completed:
- place map settings on new settings page
- when map is shown, make field 5&6 invisible
- Mainpage and PreRecordpage need horizontal layout lock function
- while workout is not started, and map is in big mode, it is annoying to scroll left
- while working out, the map circle is not centered on the map.
- unlocalized texts on BT device page
- automatic night mode
- fix battery status for HR device on record page
- on recordpage: enable onRadiusChanged and onCenterChanged in mapcircle.
- support elevation as new datapoint
- store workout type to autosave, but maybe this is not needed.
- if autosave is there on start of app, ask user if to resume workout
- add heart rate average to record page
- test rena stuff for map updating (mapcircle)
- when HR device fails during workout, the 0bpm is added to average HR
- no HR when workout isn't started
- adjustable value fields for recordpage
- view credits on about page
- missing non localized texts
- implement autosave, see github issue #9
- new values for recordpage: elevation and heartrate avg
- test: check if HR is saved to autosave file.
- bug: go back from recordscreen to prerecord. Then switch off HR. Then proceed to recordscreen. HR is still active! -> bRecordDialogRequestHRM
- rework menu on recordpage
- bring HRM values to autosave file
- what is ConfirmClearDialog for? Maybe delete this thing...
- detailspage:
	- make heartrate invisible if there is no data
	- some workouts have no max speed
	- texts need general overhaul!
- workout icon is too small on prerecordpage
- make sorting of workouts from most recent to least recent on mainpage
- Workouts need to be sorted after date on MainPage
- implement add/remove threshold profiles
- put all icons and pictures in the img folder!
- make voice language selectable and save to settings
- BUG: MainPage values for workout total time does nor fit
- search for all "Rena" and replace
- Record page: replace menu items (stop, pause, continue, start) with buttons
- cover dialog needs complete workover
	- remove app name, add app icon
- names of workouts still not good. Workouts are not sorted properly due to this.
- Alerts/thresholds:
	- implement profiles
	- save one data string per profile, including profile name
- Thresholds profiles should be renameable!
- music is paused and resumed even when no music is played. Detect first if music is playing!
- Start button on recordpage is green if accuracy says "No position"
- save last display mode to settings
- last used threshold profile is not recalled
- strange things if there are no gpx files or there is no gpx folder
- mainpage needs a progressbar.
- pause music if audio message is played
- fix mapcircle on recordpage
- [W] unknown:167 - file:///usr/share/harbour-laufhelden/qml/pages/RecordPage.qml:167: TypeError: Cannot call method 'addCoordinate' of undefined
- if a workout is cancelled before it could start properly (bad GPS), the HRM is also disconnected and you have to wait 3 seconds.
	This is a bigger thing. Maybe disable button if GPS is not online? That would also solve the problem!
- if recordpage is left, HRM is disconnected. Disconnect only if workout ends!
- In PreRecordPage, disable HRM option if there is no HRM device address
- In RecordPage, disable HRM optiion if there is no HRM device address
- On recordpage: if the map is maximized, there is a forward jump enabled to prerecordpage. This is a bug!
- Set useragent for map and app settings file to beter values
- solved issue with backjumping to mainpage. Problem was, pagestack.currentpage gives null within Component.onCompleted. Don't use this anymore!!!
- mainpage list does not fit to height of page
- after a new workout is recorded it is not viewed on main page
- record page must keep screen on (configurable)
- speed indicator for record page
- filename:
	use the local date&time as well as workout
- name:
	use the textbox text from the savedialog.
	make a text presiction, bring local date&time as well as workout to the text box on start dialog
- description:
	use the textbox text from the savedialog.
	Make no prediction and leave text box empty on start dialog.
- compatibility with new HRM belt
