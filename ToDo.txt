- rename workouts on mainpage
- introduce reward system:
	- fastest run 5/10/20/40 km

Bugs:
- if HRM is active and record page is left and then opened again, we get a BT error.
- after bt scan and finding new HRM device, not able to connect. First need to restart app.
- compiler issue, comparison between signed and unsigned
- write to log file is not working, strange no error or something...
- sometimes, maybe if app is left on cover view or even in background, screen on is not longer working





Completed:
- test: check if HR is saved to autosave file.
- bug: go back from recordscreen to prerecord. Then switch off HR. Then proceed to recordscreen. HR is still active! -> bRecordDialogRequestHRM
- rework menu on recordpage
- bring HRM values to autosave file
- what is ConfirmClearDialog for? Maybe delete this thing...
- detailspage:
	- make heartrate invisible if there is no data
	- some workouts have no max speed
	- texts need general overhaul!
- workout icon is too small on prerecordpage
- make sorting of workouts from most recent to least recent on mainpage
- Workouts need to be sorted after date on MainPage
- implement add/remove threshold profiles
- put all icons and pictures in the img folder!
- make voice language selectable and save to settings
- BUG: MainPage values for workout total time does nor fit
- search for all "Rena" and replace
- Record page: replace menu items (stop, pause, continue, start) with buttons
- cover dialog needs complete workover
	- remove app name, add app icon
- names of workouts still not good. Workouts are not sorted properly due to this.
- Alerts/thresholds:
	- implement profiles
	- save one data string per profile, including profile name
- Thresholds profiles should be renameable!
- music is paused and resumed even when no music is played. Detect first if music is playing!
- Start button on recordpage is green if accuracy says "No position"
- save last display mode to settings
- last used threshold profile is not recalled
- strange things if there are no gpx files or there is no gpx folder
- mainpage needs a progressbar.
- pause music if audio message is played
- fix mapcircle on recordpage
- [W] unknown:167 - file:///usr/share/harbour-laufhelden/qml/pages/RecordPage.qml:167: TypeError: Cannot call method 'addCoordinate' of undefined
- if a workout is cancelled before it could start properly (bad GPS), the HRM is also disconnected and you have to wait 3 seconds.
	This is a bigger thing. Maybe disable button if GPS is not online? That would also solve the problem!
- if recordpage is left, HRM is disconnected. Disconnect only if workout ends!
- In PreRecordPage, disable HRM option if there is no HRM device address
- In RecordPage, disable HRM optiion if there is no HRM device address
- On recordpage: if the map is maximized, there is a forward jump enabled to prerecordpage. This is a bug!
- Set useragent for map and app settings file to beter values
- solved issue with backjumping to mainpage. Problem was, pagestack.currentpage gives null within Component.onCompleted. Don't use this anymore!!!
- mainpage list does not fit to height of page
- after a new workout is recorded it is not viewed on main page
- record page must keep screen on (configurable)
- speed indicator for record page
- filename:
	use the local date&time as well as workout
- name:
	use the textbox text from the savedialog.
	make a text presiction, bring local date&time as well as workout to the text box on start dialog
- description:
	use the textbox text from the savedialog.
	Make no prediction and leave text box empty on start dialog.
- compatibility with new HRM belt
