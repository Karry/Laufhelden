----- ToDo for second next release to openrepos: 0.9.9 -----
- make the app start faster by scanning the GPX files directory and comparing that to a database
- add interval feature for voice assistant
- add max pace to detailspage/trackloader
- meerun imports have no max. speed
- look into old map tiles folder and delete files there. Ask user!
- map on record page: zoom into map automatically. Save and restore last zoom setting.
- pebble: if speed is choosen for third field, set unit to speed. Same with pace.
- add new feature: autopause if speed goes below certain threshold

- add leading 0 to values on recordpage




----- Other planned features for the far future: -----
- add min/max elevation to detailspage/trackloader
- fix elevation up/down bad values. This is a big thing. Elevation data needs to be corrected with appropriate algorithms.
- check if speedoverground in QGeoPositionInfo is eventually better then own speed calculation -> seems to contain no information
- implement workout comparison. Compare current workout with virtual workout in the past
- AM/PM mode for recordpage
- support all workout types from meerun (is not possible because export function in meerun is broken for many workout types, even on android)
- rename workouts on mainpage

	- fastest run 5/10/20/40 km
	- longest run (distance/time)
	- most workouts in a week/month
	- most distance in a week/month

- alert system:
	- vibration alert / sound alert
	- send vibration also to pebble via dbus call provided by rockpool (does not exist. Have to do this myself?)
	- make sound file configurable or changeable
- record page workover, add more data to view
		- current, minimum, maximum height (gps)
		- up/down travelled height
		- energy kcal
		- average speed/tempo 
		- speed/tempo of last 100m/1km

- In PreRecordPage, disable HRM option if there is no HRM device address
